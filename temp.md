❌ Bad Code:

```javascript

function sum(){return a + b;}

```

🔍 Issues:

* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will likely lead to an error or

undefined behavior.

* ❌ There are no parameters defined for the function, which means it will always rely on variables from its outer scope

(if they exist).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript

function sum(a, b) {

return a + b;

}

```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it self-contained and reusable.
* ✔️ By explicitly defining `a` and `b` as parameters, the function avoids relying on external variables, which promotes

predictability.

Final Note:

It's important to explicitly define function parameters to avoid unexpected behavior.
